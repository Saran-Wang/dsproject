## Introduction {.page_break_before}

## Literature Review {.page_break_before}
There are many studies using digital camera and advanced algorithm to estimate the concentrations of Particulate Matters. Hong et al. [@doi:10.1016/j.envint.2020.106044] developed a novel method of predicting the concentrations and diameters of outdoor ultrafine particles using street-level images and audio data in Montreal, Canada. Convolutional neural networks, multivariable linear regression and genralized additive models were used to make the predictions.

3. Visualization of the distributions of varibales
Figure @fig:Distributions shows that "Wind_Speed", "Camera_Angle", "Distance_to_Road" and "Elevation" are all in discrete distributions, while "Temp(C)" are in continuous distribution. "Pressure(kPa)" has four clusters. It should also be noted that the "Dead Time" almost shares the same distribution as "Total".

4. Correlations among variables
From the correlation map @fig:Correlations we could see that "Dead Time" are extremely correlated with "Total", with a coefficient of 1, followed by  "Camera_Angle", "Pressure(kPa)" and "Distance_to_Road", with coefficient of 0.52, 0.49, 0.44 respectively. Here you may be curious why "Dead Time" could be so closely related to "Total", and there is one possible explanation: Actually, "Dead Time" is an instrument parameter, and if there are more PM concentrations in the air, the instrument need more time to process, and vice versa.

## Model {.page_break_before}
### Shiyuan's Model {.page_break_before}
My model setup splits into two part, the first is image data extraction, the second is the selection of appropriate model to fit this dataset.

#### Image Extraction

First I want to digitize images by extracting image features, there are mainly 6 features I want to extract: RGB, image luminance, image contrast, image entropy, transmission and amount of haze removed and number of cars on streets.

1. RGB

The RGB color model is one of the most straightforward parameters describing an image. Intuitively, in this case, we may expect more blueness and greenness if the PM concentrations are low since the color of tree and sky would be brighter when the air conditions are good.
For each image, after deriving the RGB of each pixel, we take the average of them, and then divide each value by 255 to normalize it.
The figure below @fig:RGB shows the distributions of RGB in this dataset. We can see that they are nearly normally distributed with mean 0.45, 0.55 and 0.35 respectively. For blueness, we could see a second peak at around 0.42.

2. Luminance

Like RGB, luminance is also a very basic parameter describing an image, which could be an indicator of how bright the image will appear. The luminance of each image is calculated by taking the average of the luminance intensity of each pixel. 
From figure @fig:Luminance we could also see that it’s also normally distributed with a mean of around 130.

3. Contrast
The image contrast is defined as the difference between the max and min luminance intensity of an image. Study [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0145955] shows that the higher the PM concentrations, the lower contrast would be. It makes sense since the image would become vague and lighter when there are more particulate matters in the air. And often, one image would have pixels with highest intensity of 255, as well as lowest intensity of 0. Therefore, we can’t see much difference if we want to derive the absolute contrast, since it would be 1 for most of those images. Therefore, we use root mean square of image intensity to describe image contrast.

$$Absolute_Contrast = \frac{I(i_{max}, j_{max}) - I(i_{min}, j_{min})}{I(i_{max}, j_{max})+ I(i_{min}, j_{min})}$$ {#eq:absolute-contrast}
$$RMS_Contrast = \sqrt{\frac{1}{MN}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{j=1}^{M}(I(i,j)-avg(I))^2}$$ {#eq:RMS-contrast}
where I(i,j) is luminance intensity at (i,j) pixel.

From figure @fig:Contrast we could see that the distribution is a little bit right-skewed with a small peak at around 35, and a larger one at around 50.
