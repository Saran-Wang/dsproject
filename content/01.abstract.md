## Literature review {.page_break_before}
There are many studies using digital camera and advanced algorithm to estimate the concentrations of Particulate Matters. Hong et al. [@doi:10.1016/j.envint.2020.106044] developed a novel method of predicting the concentrations and diameters of outdoor ultrafine particles using street-level images and audio data in Montreal, Canada. Convolutional neural networks, multivariable linear regression and genralized additive models were used to make the predictions.
