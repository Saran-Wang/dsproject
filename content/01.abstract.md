## Literature Review {.page_break_before}
There are many studies using digital camera and advanced algorithm to estimate the concentrations of Particulate Matters. Hong et al. [@doi:10.1016/j.envint.2020.106044] developed a novel method of predicting the concentrations and diameters of outdoor ultrafine particles using street-level images and audio data in Montreal, Canada. Convolutional neural networks, multivariable linear regression and genralized additive models were used to make the predictions.

1. Variables Explanation

| Data Fields | Explanation | 
|:-----------------|:-------------:|
|Temp(C)  |ambient temperature  |
|Pressure(kPa) |air pressure | 
| Rel. Humidity | relative humidity | 
| Errors | if the air measurement equipment has error during sampling (0=no) | 
| Alarm Triggered | if any instrumental warning shows during sampling (0=no) | 
| Dilution Factor | an instrumental parameter (should close to 1) | 
| Dead Time |another instrumental parameter (ideally close to 0)  | 
| Median, Mean, Geo. Mean, Mode, and Geo. St. Dev. | parameters describe particle sizes, which can be ignored | 
| Total Conc. | an output variable from the instrument that should not be used | 
| image_file | the visual information of the traffic condition, corresponding to an image in the "frames" directory | 
| Wind_Speed |  the wind velocity during sampling| 
| Distance_to_Road | the distance between camera and road | 
| Camera_Angle | the angle of incidence between the camera and the road | 
| Elevation | the elevation between the camera and the breathing zone | 
| Total | the total measured particle number concentration (# / cm3) This is the dependent variable |

3. Visualization of the distributions of varibales
Figure @fig:Distributions shows that "Wind_Speed", "Camera_Angle", "Distance_to_Road" and "Elevation" are all in discrete distributions, while "Temp(C)" are in continuous distribution. "Pressure(kPa)" has four clusters. It should also be noted that the "Dead Time" almost shares the same distribution as "Total".

4. Correlations among variables
From the correlation map @fig:Correlations we could see that "Dead Time" are extremely correlated with "Total", with a coefficient of 1, followed by  "Camera_Angle", "Pressure(kPa)" and "Distance_to_Road", with coefficient of 0.52, 0.49, 0.44 respectively. Here you may be curious why "Dead Time" could be so closely related to "Total", and there is one possible explanation: Actually, "Dead Time" is an instrument parameter, and if there are more PM concentrations in the air, the instrument need more time to process, and vice versa.

## Model {.page_break_before}
### Shiyuan's Model {.page_break_before}
My model setup splits into two part, the first is image data extraction, the second is the selection of appropriate model to fit this dataset.

#### Image Extraction

First I want to digitize images by extracting image features, there are mainly 6 features I want to extract: RGB, image luminance, image contrast, image entropy, transmission and amount of haze removed and number of cars on streets.

1. RGB

The RGB color model is one of the most straightforward parameters describing an image. Intuitively, in this case, we may expect more blueness and greenness if the PM concentrations are low since the color of tree and sky would be brighter when the air conditions are good.
For each image, after deriving the RGB of each pixel, we take the average of them, and then divide each value by 255 to normalize it.
The figure below @fig:RGB shows the distributions of RGB in this dataset. We can see that they are nearly normally distributed with mean 0.45, 0.55 and 0.35 respectively. For blueness, we could see a second peak at around 0.42.

2. Luminance

Like RGB, luminance is also a very basic parameter describing an image, which could be an indicator of how bright the image will appear. The luminance of each image is calculated by taking the average of the luminance intensity of each pixel. 
From figure @fig:Luminance we could also see that it’s also normally distributed with a mean of around 130.
